/**
 * ByteArrayPool is a source and repository of <code>byte[]</code> objects. Its purpose is to
 * supply those buffers to consumers who need to use them for a short period of time and then
 * dispose of them. Simply creating and disposing such buffers in the conventional manner can
 * considerable heap churn and garbage collection delays on Android, which lacks good management of
 * short-lived heap objects. It may be advantageous to trade off some memory in the form of a
 * permanently allocated pool of buffers in order to gain heap performance improvements; that is
 * what this class does.
 * <p>
 * A good candidate user for this class is something like an I/O system that uses large temporary
 * <code>byte[]</code> buffers to copy data around. In these use cases, often the consumer wants
 * the buffer to be a certain minimum size to ensure good performance (e.g. when copying data chunks
 * off of a stream), but doesn't mind if the buffer is larger than the minimum. Taking this into
 * account and also to maximize the odds of being able to reuse a recycled buffer, this class is
 * free to return buffers larger than the requested size. The caller needs to be able to gracefully
 * deal with getting buffers any size over the minimum.
 * <p>
 * If there is not a suitably-sized buffer in its recycling pool when a buffer is requested, this
 * class will allocate a new buffer and return it.
 * <p>
 * This class has no special ownership of buffers it creates; the caller is free to take a buffer
 * it receives from this pool, use it permanently, and never return it to the pool; additionally,
 * it is not harmful to return to this pool a buffer that was allocated elsewhere, provided there
 * are no other lingering references to it.
 * <p>
 * This class ensures that the total size of the buffers in its recycling pool never exceeds a
 * certain byte limit. When a buffer is returned that would cause the pool to exceed the limit,
 * least-recently-used buffers are disposed.
 *
 * byte[]的回收池，用于byte[]的回收再利用，减少内存的分配和回收
 * 主要通过一个元素长度从小到大顺序的ArrayList作为byte[]的缓存，另有一个按使用时间先后排序的ArrayList属性用于缓存满时清理元素
